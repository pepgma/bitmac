bitmac
======

This is a small project presenting a page with the price of of a few everyday items in Bitcoin. The idea is to get familiar with the currency by getting a feeling of its worthines in comparison to items like a burger. This is based on the concept of the [BigMac Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac_Index).

The site is available on github sites http://pepgma.github.io/bitmac/ and the code is available at the gh-pages branch.
